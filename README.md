# Bikesharing
## Overview
In this challenge we were tasked with reading our data file in tableau and using that data to create different visualizations to better portray our data. We were tasked with this to show investors that a bike-sharing program is a good business. We created some visualizations between various points in our data to create a story that helped convey our message.

## Results
The first thing that was required for us to properly display our data was to convert our "trip duration" to a datetime object. After completion we had to transfer the data to Tableau so we could further analyize our data set. Once in Tableau we created many sheets which we added to our story; I had added a total of 7 visualizations to show the investors.
1. August Peak Hours 
  1. This visualization shows us the peak times for riders to go out and use the bikes.      This gives us a sense of how many bikes were used, at what times they were used, and when the busiest times were.

2. Checkout Times For Users
  2. This visualization shows us the duration of time each user was using their bikes for. With this we can see how long each bike was checkout for and based off that we can furthur calculate how much money can be made from each bike.
3. Checkout Times for Gender
  3. This visualization is a more in-depth analysis of the previous one. We further break down the checkout times and categorize them with gender. This shows us which gender is more likely to rent out the bikes and for how long. Using this we can advertize specifically to a certain group
4. Trips by Weekday Per Hour
  4. This visualization shows us the hotspot for the week. We can see through our chart which days and what times were the most populated for renting out a bike. We can conclude that the times that bikes were most used during the week were 6am-9am and 5pm-8pm. We can assume that the reason why this is because most people would be commuting to and from work at those times.
5. Trips by Gender (Weekday Per Hour)
  5. This visualization goes into more depth than the previous. We can see that we have broken down our data into 3 groups male, female, and unknown. This data shows us which gender is more likely to use the bikes and at what time.
6. User Trips by Gender by Weekday
  6. This visualization helps us determine who is using the product. We can see that a majority of the users are subscribers and very few are not subscribers. 
7. Top Ending Locations
  7. This visualization helps us determine which areas are more likely to have more traffic. We can see various points on the map that show us where user trips were ended. Based off that data we can schedule bike maintenance, target ads at that location, and get a better sense of why people are heading to that location.

## Summary
At the end of this story we can conclude that there are many factors that should be considered before starting this business. There are many control variables that can be used in the companies favor to better advertise their product. We can see various locations were the product thrives and why it thrives. A couple of visualizations that can be used to further our study is we can see how much revenue is being provided by these bikes. Another visulization would be how much maintenance is required for these bikes and how much durability do they provide.
